    <h5>1. Commit
        A commit is like saving a change in your project. Each commit records the changes you made, and you can add a message describing what you changed. It’s like a "save point" you can go back to if needed.
        
        Example: You fix a bug in the code and commit it with the message "Fixed login button bug."
        
        2. Push
        When you push, you’re sending your saved commits from your computer to GitHub (or another remote repository). This makes the changes available for others to see and work with.
        
        Example: After committing, you push the changes so your teammates can see the bug fix you made.
        
        3. Pull
        A pull is like downloading the latest changes from GitHub to your computer. If someone else has made changes, pulling lets you update your copy of the project with those changes.
        
        Example: You pull the latest changes from GitHub to get the updates your teammate made to the project.
        
        4. Merge
        A merge combines changes from one branch (version of the project) into another. It’s often done to bring changes from a feature branch into the main branch once it’s finished.
        
        Example: You merge your "new-feature" branch into the "main" branch so that everyone can use the new feature in the main project.
        
        5. Pull Request (PR)
        A pull request is a request to review and potentially merge your changes into another branch (often the main branch). It lets others look over your changes before they become part of the main project.
        
        Example: After finishing a new feature, you create a pull request for your teammates to review your changes. If they approve, they’ll merge it into the main branch.</h5>
